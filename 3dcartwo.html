        In celebration of MANSORY's 30th anniversary in 2020, the "Le MANSORY" emerges as an extraordinary edition, limited to a mere 3 units globally, following the tradition of "One car per decade". This exclusive masterpiece bears the distinct signature of MANSORY's complete vehicle transformations, encapsulating three decades of automotive excellence.
        Crafted as an homage to the iconic Ford GT40 and its legendary triumph at Le Mans in 1966, the "Le MANSORY" embodies the essence of motorsport prowess. Its compelling presence is immediately apparent, as the extended 5 cm full carbon body showcases a comprehensive aerodynamic overhaul, resonating with racing enthusiasts.
        The heart of the "Le MANSORY" undergoes a remarkable transformation. The standard V6 twin-turbo engineâ€™s 483 KW (656 hp) output is elevated to a commanding 710 hp through meticulous engine management enhancements. This power, coupled with refined aerodynamics, propels the "Le MANSORY" to a remarkable top speed of 354 km/h, effortlessly surpassing the standard's 347 km/h.
        Exquisite forged rims, measuring 9x21" at the front and 12x21" at the rear, wrapped in high-performance "Continental Sport Contact 6" tires, complete the harmonious and elegant look while effectively harnessing the increased power.

        An entirely novel highlight of the "Le MANSORY" lies in its distinct and exclusive LED main headlights. These newly designed headlights, arranged in four units, grant the car an independent visual identity. Drawing inspiration from the standard Ford GT while infusing a unique charisma, these headlights perfectly capture the essence of the "Le MANSORY".
        The interior is a testament to MANSORY's artistry, transforming the cabin into a realm of luxury. The dominant "Bleurion Race" blue hue merges with dark grey visible carbon fiber, creating an atmosphere of refined elegance. White-blue Alcantara graces the dashboard and sports seats, while exquisite carbon applications adorn the interior, harmonizing every element.
        The "Le MANSORY" is an exclusive masterpiece, limited to an exclusive trio worldwide, a testament to MANSORY's legacy of crafting unparalleled automotive expressions.
